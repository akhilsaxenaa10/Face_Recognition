Deployed version of the Face Recognition System can be accessed using this Link:- https://face-recognition-by-akhil-saxena.streamlit.app/

Description:
This project implements a Face Recognition System using OpenCV and Streamlit. 
It allows users to upload an image, and the system processes the image to detect and recognize facial features.

Features:
1. Upload image: Users can upload an image to analyze.
2. Facial features detection: Detects key facial landmarks and processes the image for facial recognition.
3. Real-time feedback: The system provides real-time feedback on the processed image.

Technologies Used:
1. Python,
2. OpenCV for image processing and face recognition.
3. Streamlit for the user interface

How to Run Locally:

Clone this repository:
1. git clone https://github.com/akhil-saxena/face-recognition-system.git

Install the necessary dependencies:
2. pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:
3. streamlit run app.py
